# Square Image Cropper for PFP

**This website lets you crop images into a square while previewing how your icon will look as a social media profile picture.**

There are several websites let you crop images into a square, and you can even set a profile picture without cropping at all. However, you usually can't see how it will actually look until after you set it, and adjusting it over and over again can be a hassle. That's why I created this website. It lets you crop images into a square while previewing how your icon will look as a social media profile picture.

## How to Use

1. Go to [this website](https://sheetau.github.io/cropimage.github.io/).
2. Drag and drop or click to select and upload the image you want to crop.
3. Drag image to adjust crop position. use mouse wheel on image or use zoom slider to adjust crop size.
4. Use preview radius slider or click preview icons on right side to adjust corner radius of preview.
5. Click download. (PNG images are saved as PNG, and all others are saved as JPG. Please note that cropping does not include the preview radius.)
